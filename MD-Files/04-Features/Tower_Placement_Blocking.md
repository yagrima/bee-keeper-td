# Tower Placement Blocking - Complete Documentation

## Problem Description

**Issue**: Players could place multiple towers on the same grid position, causing overlapping towers and visual/functional conflicts.

**Requirement**: Once a tower is placed on a grid position, that position must be blocked from further tower placement until the tower is removed.

## Solution Implementation

### Core Principle
**Grid Position Occupancy**: Each grid position can only contain one tower. When a tower is placed, that position becomes occupied and unavailable for new tower placement.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Enhanced TowerDefense Validation (`scripts/TowerDefense.gd`)

```gdscript
func is_position_occupied(position: Vector2) -> bool:
    """Check if position is occupied by another tower"""
    # Check tower placer towers
    if tower_placer and tower_placer.placed_towers:
        for tower in tower_placer.placed_towers:
            if tower and is_instance_valid(tower):
                var distance = position.distance_to(tower.position)
                if distance < 32:  # Within tower radius
                    return true
    
    # Check metaprogression towers
    for tower in metaprogression_towers:
        if tower and is_instance_valid(tower):
            var distance = position.distance_to(tower.position)
            if distance < 32:  # Within tower radius
                return true
    
    return false
```

**Key Features:**
- **Dual Tower Check**: Validates both `tower_placer.placed_towers` and `metaprogression_towers`
- **Distance-Based Collision**: 32px radius for tower collision detection
- **Instance Validation**: Ensures towers are still valid before checking

#### 2. Enhanced TowerPlacer Validation (`scripts/TowerPlacer.gd`)

```gdscript
func is_valid_placement_position(pos: Vector2) -> bool:
    # ... existing boundary and path checks ...
    
    # Check if there's already a tower here
    for tower in placed_towers:
        if tower.global_position.distance_to(pos) < grid_size / 2:
            return false
    
    # Check metaprogression towers from TowerDefense
    var td_scene = get_parent()
    if td_scene.has_method("get_metaprogression_towers"):
        var metaprogression_towers = td_scene.get_metaprogression_towers()
        for tower in metaprogression_towers:
            if tower and is_instance_valid(tower):
                var distance = tower.global_position.distance_to(pos)
                if distance < grid_size / 2:
                    return false

    return true
```

**Key Features:**
- **Cross-System Validation**: Checks both local `placed_towers` and metaprogression towers
- **Grid-Based Collision**: Uses `grid_size / 2` for precise grid collision detection
- **Parent Scene Access**: Accesses metaprogression towers through parent TowerDefense scene

#### 3. Metaprogression Tower Access (`scripts/TowerDefense.gd`)

```gdscript
func get_metaprogression_towers() -> Array:
    """Get all metaprogression towers for placement validation"""
    return metaprogression_towers
```

**Purpose**: Provides TowerPlacer with access to metaprogression towers for validation.

#### 4. Tower State Management (`scripts/TowerDefense.gd`)

```gdscript
func place_picked_up_tower(position: Vector2):
    # ... positioning logic ...
    
    # Add to tower placer
    if tower_placer:
        tower_placer.placed_towers.append(picked_up_tower)
        print("Tower added to tower_placer.placed_towers")
    
    # Remove from metaprogression towers
    metaprogression_towers.erase(picked_up_tower)
    
    # ... cleanup logic ...
```

**Key Features:**
- **State Transfer**: Moves tower from `metaprogression_towers` to `placed_towers`
- **Consistent Validation**: Tower becomes part of standard placement validation
- **Clean State Management**: Maintains proper tower ownership

## Validation Flow

### 1. Hotkey Placement (Q/W/E/R)
```
User presses hotkey → TowerPlacer.start_tower_placement() → 
TowerPlacer.is_valid_placement_position() → 
Checks placed_towers + metaprogression_towers → 
Allows/denies placement
```

### 2. Metaprogression Pickup
```
User clicks metaprogression tower → TowerDefense.pickup_metaprogression_tower() → 
User clicks placement position → TowerDefense.is_valid_tower_placement_position() → 
Checks tower_placer.placed_towers + metaprogression_towers → 
Allows/denies placement
```

### 3. Tower State Transition
```
Metaprogression tower placed → 
Removed from metaprogression_towers → 
Added to tower_placer.placed_towers → 
Now blocks future placement at same position
```

## Collision Detection Logic

### Distance-Based Collision
- **TowerDefense**: 32px radius collision detection
- **TowerPlacer**: `grid_size / 2` (16px) collision detection
- **Grid Alignment**: Ensures towers snap to grid centers

### Validation Hierarchy
1. **Boundary Check**: Position within 20x15 grid
2. **Path Check**: Position not on enemy path
3. **Occupancy Check**: Position not occupied by existing tower
4. **Resource Check**: Sufficient honey for tower cost

## Implementation Benefits

### 1. **Consistent Behavior**
- Same validation logic for hotkey and metaprogression placement
- Unified collision detection across all placement methods
- Consistent user experience

### 2. **Performance Optimized**
- Distance-based collision detection (O(n) complexity)
- Instance validation prevents invalid tower checks
- Efficient grid-based positioning

### 3. **State Management**
- Clear tower ownership (metaprogression vs. placed)
- Proper state transitions when towers are placed
- No memory leaks or orphaned references

### 4. **Extensible Design**
- Easy to add new tower types
- Simple to modify collision detection
- Scalable for larger grids

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Basic Placement Blocking**
- Place tower at position (10, 5)
- Attempt to place another tower at same position
- **Expected**: Second placement blocked

### 2. **Cross-System Blocking**
- Place tower via hotkey (Q/W/E/R)
- Attempt to place metaprogression tower at same position
- **Expected**: Metaprogression placement blocked

### 3. **Metaprogression State Transition**
- Pick up metaprogression tower
- Place it on grid
- Attempt to place another tower at same position
- **Expected**: Second placement blocked

### 4. **Grid Boundary Validation**
- Place tower at grid edge (0, 0)
- Attempt to place tower at adjacent position (1, 0)
- **Expected**: Adjacent placement allowed

## Debug Features

### Comprehensive Logging
```gdscript
print("Position occupied: %s" % position)
print("Tower added to tower_placer.placed_towers")
print("Tower removed from metaprogression_towers")
```

### Validation Tracking
- Logs position occupancy checks
- Tracks tower state transitions
- Monitors collision detection
- Verifies grid alignment

## Maintenance Notes

### 1. **Keep Validation Synchronized**
- Both systems must check all tower types
- Maintain consistent collision detection
- Update distance thresholds if needed

### 2. **State Management**
- Ensure proper tower ownership
- Clean up invalid references
- Maintain consistent state transitions

### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
- Monitor collision detection performance
- Optimize for larger tower counts
- Consider spatial partitioning if needed

### 4. **Testing Requirements**
- Test all placement methods
- Verify cross-system blocking
- Check edge cases and boundaries

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the solution can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting the enhanced validation functions
2. Removing metaprogression tower checks
3. Restoring original validation logic
4. Maintaining basic placement functionality

## Code Architecture

### TowerDefense.gd
- `is_position_occupied()`: Enhanced validation with metaprogression towers
- `get_metaprogression_towers()`: Access function for TowerPlacer
- `place_picked_up_tower()`: State transition management

### TowerPlacer.gd
- `is_valid_placement_position()`: Enhanced validation with metaprogression towers
- Cross-system tower checking
- Grid-based collision detection

### State Flow
1. **Placement Request**: User attempts tower placement
2. **Validation Check**: System checks all tower types
3. **Collision Detection**: Distance-based collision check
4. **Placement Decision**: Allow or deny based on validation
5. **State Update**: Update tower ownership if placed

This implementation ensures that no two towers can occupy the same grid position, providing a clean and consistent tower placement experience across all placement methods.
